## Is the road safe? Answer 2nd and 3rd...
2nd -> I have generated random values for x. So I
did not take any data set.

3rd-> I have used regression analysis because it is simple to use and 
it helps determine which factors matter most, which it can ignore, and
 how those factors interact with each other.
 So firstly I generated 1000 random values for x by using rand
 function, and then I plot x and y.After that I made the model
 and done the analysis.Regression allows us to use more than two
  independent variables. This is its most important benefit.
  Regression analysis helps an organisation to understand what 
  their data points represent and use them accordingly with the
   help of business analytical techniques in order to do better
 decision-making.
